# Diversity-Survey
Survey about Diversity and Workplace Inclusion in FOSS Organizations

This repo contains some interview of existing FOSS contributors about Diversity and Workplace Inclusion in the organizations and/or communities they are involved with and their related experiences. The interviewees are from a diverse range of backgrounds(not just those from minority  or underrepresented groups in FOSS), geographical locations and contribute to different FOSS organization with many contributing or being involved with multiple FOSS organizations/ communities at a time. However, we only talk about diversity and workplace inclusion in FOSS organizations and communities.

The interviews and surveys were collected via video and/or in person with an intention of engaging with the interviewees while they answer questions so that they find it easy to open up and describe their experiences and communication issues are limited. 

I would love to have any feedback on the questions, process, target audience or any part of this research actually.
